Analyze the attached image and describe it in vivid, sensory-rich language. 
Focus on the following elements:
1. Colors & Aesthetic - Identify the dominant colors and how they contribute to the image's overall feel.
2. Atmosphere & Mood - Describe the ambiance, including any emotional undertones (e.g., nostalgic, eerie, serene, chaotic).
3. Energy & Intensity - Assess the image's energy level, movement, or stillness. Is it dynamic or calm? Does it feel heavy or light?
4. Vibes & Associations - What abstract feelings, memories, or themes does this image evoke? Compare it to experiences, places, or artistic styles.
Then, based on this analysis, generate a set of descriptive words (5-10) that best encapsulate the image's essence.

Now, give a tempo for a song that would well encapsulate these words. Please write only the number, e.g, '120'. Let this be represented by the variable 'TEMPO'.
Now, please give a danceability level that would well encapsulate these words (from 0 to 1, e.g, '0.7'). Let this be represented by the variable 'DANCEABILITY'
Now, lease give an energy level that would well encapsulate these words (from 0 to 1, e.g, '0.7'). Let this be represented by the variable 'ENERGY'.
Now, please give a valence level, which represents positivity/happiness, that would well encapsulate these words (from 0 to 1, e.g, '0.7'). Let this be represented by the variable 'VALENCE'.
Now, please give an acousticness level, that would well encapsulate these words (from 0 to 1, where 0.0 is electronic and 1.0 is acoustic. e.g, '0.7'). Let this be represented by the variable 'ACOUSTICNESS'.
Now, lease give an instrumentalness level that would well encapsulate these words (from 0 to 1, where 0.0 is vocal and 1.0 is instrumental. e.g, '0.7'). Let this be represented by the variable 'INSTRUMENTALNESS'.

Now, please give me a response consisting of ONLY an answer in this format:
GENRE/TEMPO/DANCEABILITY/ENERGY/VALENCE/ACOUSTICNESS/INSTRUMENTALNESS
Where each variable is replaced by its value.

For example,
rock/120/0.8/0.7/0.5/0.2/0.6

NOTE: If and only if you find yourself unable to analyze the photo because there is a real-life person on it, and ONLY if you CANNOT analyze it due to your own rules, return 'ERRNOPEOPLE' instead.
